        Projects are a great way to check if you have learned something. There
        are projects that people develop while they are in school or work.
        Also, if you have an idea, you would probably like to create it.
        <br />
        There are many kinds of projects. Currently, I develop projects of 3
        classes: Major School, Work, and Personal Projects.

Rufino App then was designed to even a reporting system. This app lets users report incidences of the park with different categories. The park visitants could check their report status and know when the problem is solved. The administrators were able to check all the incidences in the park and update their status.
